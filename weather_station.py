    Pi Temperature Station
    By John M. Wargo
    www.johnwargo.com

    This is a Raspberry Pi project that measures environment values (temperature and humidity ) using
    the a DHT22 Temperature sensor then uploads the data to a Weather Underground weather station.

    This application uses the Adafruit Python libraries for the DHT22 from:
    https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT

    The temperature reading code was shamelesly copied from the example project located at:
    https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/blob/master/examples/simpletest.py
